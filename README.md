# plateIt
Community run applications for maintaining delicious food recipes built with MEAN stack. 

Idea behind it: 

Community run web forums where people post recipies for dishes that other members can try, review and comment on. 
For those ambitious home cooks who are looking for a challenge or those who just enjoy new and exotic dishes on a budget.
